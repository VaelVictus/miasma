# main.js Improvement Ideas

The following changes build on the existing HTML structure in `index.php` and focus on reliability, maintainability, and perceived performance without altering the current user-facing layout.

## 1. Normalize slider bootstrapping
* Replace the implicit `document.slider` global with an explicit module pattern or factory that returns the slider instance. The current reliance on global state makes it easy for future scripts to collide and complicates testing. Wiring the instance through closures will also let us stub dependencies (e.g., `loadNotes`) during tests.
* Defer DOM queries until the `DOMContentLoaded` callback and cache the results once. Right now we repeatedly call `document.getElementById` and `document.querySelector` throughout the slider methods even though the relevant elements never change.

## 2. Harden DOM interactions
* Introduce a small helper such as `queryRequired(selector)` that throws a descriptive error when `#slider_container`, `#mobile_view`, or tab buttons go missing. That keeps runtime checks centralized and surfaces template drift quickly during development.
* Add early-return guards when wiring optional controls (e.g., `prev_button`, `next_button`, `variety_switcher`). This prevents hard crashes if we tweak the markup in `index.php` and forget to retain a specific hook.

## 3. Improve fetch handling in `loadNotes`
* Use `async/await` with `try/catch` to read `trottering_notes.php`, checking `response.ok` and rendering a friendly fallback (such as a “Notes failed to load” banner inside `#game_notes`).
* Track the latest in-flight request with an `AbortController`, so rapidly switching specimens via the dropdown or thumbnails doesn’t leave us with out-of-order note content.

## 4. Smooth slider transitions
* Replace the fixed `setTimeout(..., 10)` used to finish slides with the `transitionend` event. This ties the JavaScript lifecycle directly to the CSS in `index.scss`, preventing visual glitches if we tweak animation durations.
* Consider swapping the manual class juggling for `requestAnimationFrame`-based updates when we revisit the animation CSS, which will give the browser a more predictable paint schedule on low-powered devices.

## 5. Accessibility polish
* Mirror the thumbnail click behaviour on keyboard focus by adding `keydown` handlers for <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Space</kbd> on `.thumbnail` elements, matching the existing arrow-key support.
* Update the dynamically injected buttons (`#prev_button`, `#next_button`) to include `aria-label` text describing the target specimen so screen readers get context that currently only exists visually.

## 6. Configurable variety switching
* Replace the hard-coded `switchableVarieties` array with data attributes on the `<select>` options or `<div class="slider-item">` nodes. This keeps the mapping close to the HTML source of truth and lets designers add alternates without touching JavaScript.
* Add a small state machine that mirrors the toggled specimen in the dropdown (`#folderSelect`) so the UI stays in sync when users alternate between base and alternate varieties.

## 7. Testing hooks
* Export pure helper functions (e.g., `normalizeFolderName`, `buildVisibleIndices`) so we can cover them with unit tests in a future Jest harness without needing to mock the DOM.
* Wrap the `DOMContentLoaded` initialization in a function like `initMiasmaViewer(document)` so we can call it from Cypress or Puppeteer smoke tests once we automate regression checks.

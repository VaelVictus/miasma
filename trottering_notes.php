    or,<br/>

    An Essay On Islandscript</b>
    <p>

    From his own discoveries in the peat-bed of the Institute, it is easy to deduce that one of the 

    Eremite's greatest Works, <i>The Underweather Vanity</i>, containing an account of his time in Loss, was 

    completed primarily in Islandscript, a typographical philosophy which encompasses not only the 

    lettering, kerning, and the layout of any one page, but out to the ordering, binding and presentation 

    of the entire Work, and then up further, into the loft of the writer's own sensibilities and lifestyle. 

    It is a House Style lived in completely, built around a man of exacting tastes and perfectionist 

    practice.
    </p>
    <p>

    Consider the mislaid <i>incunabula</i>. From what we know of its construction, it is extremely large and

    sturdy, build of solid mahogany planks, buoyant and resistant to rot, and in designation of size

    being perhaps Octuple Elephant. From the Eremite's own references, I would estimate that when 

    stood on end, it stands much higher than a <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerk<span class="red">////</span>, perhaps five feet six in some calculations,

    and as wide across as a door. The pages within are, as any sufficiently sick <span class="red">\\_\</span>clerk<span class="red">//__</span> will know,

    of varying qualities, weaves, pulps and compositions (owing to the Eremite's rather mongrel process

    of procuring raw materials) and were bound inside the <i>incunabula</i> with brass pins hammered flush

    into the wood.
    </p>
    <p>

    Some pages span the entire height and width of the <i>inculabula</i>, and may more properly be called 

    tapestries whereas others, such as the ones from which <span class="red">____</span>Clerk<span class="red">____</span> Chester-Stokes' transcript 

    derives, are or were mere scraps, no wider across than a palm. I had the honour of studying this 

    shard before it was destroyed, one of the many presented in <i>quarto</i>, a format of which, despite its 

    rather bizarre appearance to this <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span>, was apparently a favourite of both the author and 

    the transcriber.
    </p>
    <p>

    If one were to imagine these pages as islands on a sea of wood, some the size of continents, others 

    of atolls and reefs, then this metaphor extends down into the text itself; the Eremite very often 

    grouped his thoughts in tight enclaves of words, the last descender providing a ferry to the next, 

    and then the next, and the next, and the next. And, remember, now, poppets, remember the pins?

    Any <span class="red">\_\\</span>clerk<span class="red">//__</span> may bend their knees, if there are not too turgid, and root about their quarren; 

    there, one is almost guaranteed to uncover the gleam of bronze. Consider the pin, raise it to your 

    eye; see the mica of the sea, the kink the waves put in. Even in the glue of his thoughts, the Eremite

    was considered marine. He considered all things islands, and lonely, to boot. This <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span>

    sympathises.
    </p>
    <p>

    I leave the above as an introduction to my tenure overseeing the typographical study of the 

    Eremite's oeuvre; all queries should now be left in the soil for me, and faith taken that the worms 

    will find me. They will not find <span class="red">____</span>Clerk<span class="red">____</span> Chester-Stokes. Following her promotion up 

    and out of clerkhood, I will be taking her place. Though this may come as a shock and relief to 

    many of you, I would ask you not to speak too ill of her, or groan too loudly; she will still be 

    amongst you, in a supervisory role. However, those of you who tired of her constant boasts about 

    her breeding, her overbearing attendance to every Excavation, her insistence on the use of proper 

    Latin, regardless of a <span class="red">____</span>clerk's<span class="red">_///</span> mother tongue, the smug accomplishments of her parents, their 

    riches, their castle high on some muggy moor, you may be secure in the knowledge that your Work 

    may begin afresh, free of interference. For those of you who miss her most comforting words and 

    coos, the ones on the edge of hearing, hear this. 
    </p>
    <p>

    <span class="red">SHHHHHHH</span>
    </p>
    <p>

    Poppets! 
    </p>
    <p>

    Poppets!
    </p>
    <p>

    Eventually, you know, you know, her size would have affected her performance; while it is this 

    <span class="red">____</span>clerk's<span class="red">____</span> opinion that all women are destined to grow fat, I could not allow the Institute's 

    published results to be compromised by slovenly, tubular fingers. Her new role is still suited to her 

    suffocating presence, as well as her instincts of motherhood, and she should be extremely proud of 

    her promotions; they have carried her further than any of her kind before. 
    </p>
    <p>

    I believe that I have proved my competence in these matters, and take on her role with aplomb, 

    though it grieves me to present her despicable transcript as true Work, completed when she was 

    only a young <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerk<span class="red">////</span>, newly arrived and smooth of promotion. It had been made necessary by 

    some hidden vandalism deep below the earth, in which the original was lost to us. Her original 

    notes were condescending and incomplete, and have been discarded, or truncated.
    </p>
    <p>

    A lesser Work, full of inconsistencies of pathos and inelegant turns of phrase. She has almost 

    certainly made mistakes; even the pigments are wrong, diluted dustings of the Eremite's own ink. 

    Perhaps it was her, bumbling through the Ouse, that ripped the original, priceless shard in twain, 

    and brought us this scratching instead?

    <span class="red">__\_</span>Later Addendum<span class="red">//__</span> I have revealed this object for study once again. I had quite forgotten about it in all the fuss; I envy the \\\\clerk//// to whom it is assigned. Every part of it is a flirt to the senses; the hipped sides of it, the glint of turquoise in any light, that beautiful colour. The Eremite refers to it, specifically, in his writings. I transcribe from my own Excavation: “And so I took tea with each of them in turn, sitting them at the Persuavant, fresh herbs under their noses, and I explained where I came from, and what I did, and I enacted the wind to make its music, to go, by my signal, W O O. I made the preparations, and more and more of them came.”
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe and officially posit that these herbs were presented in the vase (not a dour urn as other clerks have marked it). I make an appeal to the <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerk<span class="red">////</span> who discovers it to touch its sides, imagine the hands that smoothed the boiling clay into place, giving the whole thing the impression of skin. Stop at the threshold, and imagine what it would be like to approach this, and find the Eremite next to it, waiting for you, beneath the trees, the wind fingering its own holes, the smell of hot nuts roasting somewhere within. This is not a warning. It is the most elegant of lures.

    <b>Notes</b>
    <p>
    Despite constant correspondence to the contrary, this particular piece of refuse has surfaced again and again and again, clasped to the chest of countless poor <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerks<span class="red">////</span> who believe that they have uncovered something marvellous. Do not let the pattern deceive you; this is refuse, designed to be discarded, an ephemera marked only with the tabulations of breaths once made, mucus once blown, and worries once worried. The blood, I <span class="red">imagine</span>, wakes something up inside you, but do not overdo it; there was no excitement here. He only used it to dab at his tubes when they leaked.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you require yet another hypothetical exercise to steady you, <span class="red">imagine</span> this; the Eremite stood before you, your knees shaking at how tall he is, how elegant, how nimble his hands and how developed his cranium. Now <span class="red">imagine</span> presenting him with this gift, from his deep past. Now, <span class="red">imagine</span> him laughing gently at your efforts, at the efforts of idiots who would build a cargo cult around his hankies!
    </p>
    <p>
    The exercise is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
    The only point of note is the patterning; the <i>fleur de coquette</i> on an azure field is consistent with the other parlayware in the Eremite’s possession; as many of you will know from your Work, the Eremite enjoyed his possessions in sets, and was nothing but a completist.

    - Do <span class="red">NNNOT</span> bury it afresh.

    <p>It is lucky then, <span class="red">___\</span>clerks<span class="red">//_/</span>, that I am adapted to such calamities, and possess an Alexandrian memory. It must have been all the declensions that I was forced to learn. </p>

    <p>Can any of you, in your states, remember your parents?</p>

    <span class="red">SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</span>

    <p>I do. I remember the day that Daddy sped off in the sidecar. It was not June, and so the rock-rose was bloody in the clints. Mummy and I followed in the wagon, across the virgate and down to the port, and watched him standing, on the deck of Mummy's ferry, shouting that he would 'knock up some Boche ponces', or some equally stupid Babel, translated on the wind. </p>

    <p>His sergeant brought back his wedding ring before Guy Fawkes Night. As Norris served him tea, he told us how twenty privates had tried to steal it from his pocket, as he zigged and zagged his way back to England through the trenches. I can see it so very clearly, the herringbone of his trousers, and the little cardboard box perched atop them. I loved that comparison; it looked a little like our house, stood in fertile fields.</p>

    <p>The sergeant opened the box, and took out, very carefully, twenty fingers, and laid them on the Pembroke table. Of course, none of them were Daddy's, and so we shooed the sergeant from our life. We fed the fingers to the pigs. </p>

    <p>It would pay all of you, <span class="red">___\</span>clerks<span class="red">//_/</span>, to practice. Remember the little things. What did they call the herbs and flowers, where you were from? What weather touched you?</p>

    <p>Exercises for another time. </p>

    <p>No matter how much I might remember of this Work, day after day after day we are losing more of what he was planning to say. This Work was a series of notations, for some grander, dreamt mural. I do wish that we had Uncle Oscar's writings here, and Praester's unshredded and sensible. Together, they might flare into so many of those trenches in my revision. </p>

    <p>Without the whole Work, for instance, we will never know what Friend was really like, as a person, or whether she did love him, as he so desperate to be loved. We will never know what became of the Bog Ponies, or whether the Town Cryer was a man or a woman or something else, or what it was that the Eremite did to Mr. Lights, in those lonely, ultimate days on the valley floor.</p>

    <p>What we have instead, left behind, is a quinquereme preparation, an <i>itinerarium</i> of travel out of Loss, a road diary a little more juvenile than most. Only one scrap of page remains; let us see quite how much of the rest I remember, from previous readings. It is puzzling; the rest of me is waning, planing down to the grain, but my mind stays as sharp as an <i>ensis</i>. I have not quite descended to the sty just yet.</p>

    <p>I think that I might know who I am.</p>

    <p>I cannot be expected to remember quite everything, <i>veritas</i>;. The parts that I do remember I have put into order of pressure, as best I am able, and though I am no artist I have provided descriptions of the sketches and scenes that made a particular impression on my young mind. All stress is the Eremite's, not my own, though gaps may be in my own knowledge or in the record itself. </p>

    <p>Firstly, the <i>contexte</i>. It seems that the Eremite was by now already on the long road out of Loss, the caprine, darting track plotted in the stars and the breadcrumbs of himself, trudging in the other direction all that time before. We may assume, from the notes that he made on each day of his journey, that he was finding it hard to delude himself any longer. His guilt at the death of Loss, at the dousing of an entire folk, is so impregnated throughout. Look at the records of his breath, recorded every evening. We can <span class="red">imagine</span> that he did not sleep much. Nor was there any reason to hide these records; he was so assured of his companion's illiteracy that he knew that his crimes would never be understood. What were thirty-nine scratches, every single day, to a Friend?</p>

    <p>The records of breath do confirm one of the Eremite's virtues; throughout his entire life, no matter his dimension, he was extremely regular in every faculty. Look to the tabulations and calculations throughout <i>The Underweather Vanity</i>. He has even boasted, in other Works, of cults marking their festivals by his toilet. And indeed, the breaths here do form a calendar; thirty nine, without fail, in and out, every single day. </p>

    <p>However, as you all should have been taught, every calendar has its leap. There was one such energetic day, in Loss, a hot day when he was unsated by the cooking of the very worst cook, and decided to eat from a different sort of plate.</p>

    <p>The Eremite has made no secret in the record that he wanted Friend, in that childish way that we have all come to recognise. I thought that I might have to puzzle it out, this calamity that murdered a public, but he was almost triumphant in his blatancy.</p>

    <p>On the day that he removed his mask and kissed her, he registered only thirty breaths, in and out of his tubes.</p>

    <p>Nine is not an important number, in any theology that I know of, but he would spend the rest of his time in Loss fixated upon those lost breaths, trying not to accuse himself. <i>I feel well</i>, we can <span class="red">imagine</span> him telling himself, <i>there is nothing wrong with me</i>, as they moaned through the dirt all around him. He was always so excellent at <span class="red">imagining</span> other outcomes and other blames. Perhaps he might have blamed Friend for distracting him, for making him lose count that day, for some atmospheric disturbance, the influence of spirits, anything, but his own want. </p>

    <p>You can just <span class="red">imagine</span> him, can't you, boygirls, on the road, checking her from temple to temple, looking for any sort of mantle, probing her mouth with those incredible fingers, hunting for cobblestones. He would even check her back, for the bruises that the rest of her people developed, evidence, he thought, of flagellation. </p>

    <p>But, of course, he would find nothing on her, and so reinforce his delusion that he had not infected them. She did not wear a black crown, and so he enthroned her in other ways, certain of his innocence. If she was well, the only one who had smelt his breath in a hundred years, then he could not be accused.</p>

    <p>But who was there still to accuse him? </p>

    <p>The pigs, for all their lack of discernment, did teach me something as a girl. I often found them very gross, and would stand at the edge of the sty after school, shouting my subjunctives in and listening for the screams back.</p>

    <p>Mummy and Daddy showed me, however, how the beasts could be used as a barometer. About five times in my infanthood a plague would pass through the herd, and they were loath to cull the whole lot. And so they would quietly walk amongst them, wearing homemade masks out of sack and snorkel, and make an inspection. They would ignore the sows turning out cold paste instead of milk, ignore the backfatters grinding their teeth into flour, ignore the boars corning each other in blind rages. </p>

    <p>Before long, they would find the happiest pig, the one without sores or mucus, and lead it off to be shot, far from any watercourse.</p>

    was a noble beast, when I met it, but all this hunger now<br/>
    is making me impolite; am imagining it steamed with butter<br/>

    <br/>
    <span class="red">[A<i> lacunae</i>.]</span><br/>
    <br/>
    Ring-In-Opal, on the red tide. It was a pleasant journey with the Lord Quahog, most royal of his kind, and he let me touch the crown jewels nestled in his bivalve. I can almost taste the jacuzzi of blood that I sat in, reclining on his anus. It was too cold for algae, so we motored through the floes, up to the boundary of Ring-In-Opal itself, two slabs of bull ice<br/>
    <br/>
    I remember the mist coiling off them with envy <br/>
    is so hot here today<br/>
    all the suns have followed me<br/>
    a fold of them in the SSS <br/>
    <br/>
    i sent her on ahead instead<br/>

    telling to meet me in two days<br/>

    she is sik<span class="red">[sic]</span> with an empty belly<br/>

    I think shes forgotten about them all already<br/>
    <br/>
    i can think clearly now, with her gone <br/>
    I can spend the day in Ring-In-Opal<br/>
    <br/>
    I had long since said farewell to Lord Quahog, and been amongst them for many days, before I met Whale-bane. He considered himself a bard, and though he was not much of a singer, just a boy in a fine coat, all he did was pluck. He knew gut very well. They all did, in Ring-In-Opal. <br/>
    <br/>
    They liked me there.<br/>
    <br/>
    I remember, floating over the diplomat behind me on swim bladders - they loved that, too, it was all the more ice, all the more territory, for them. There was not a horse chestnut for leagues, but it didn't matter<br/>
    <br/>
    Every day, before he found the courage to introduce himself, he watched me from his berg, the skins drawn around his waist, brown walrus, or was it white?
    I saw the tusks above his bed<br/>

    Ring-In-Opal, as a civilisation, did not have chairs either, but unlike Friend they were fascinated by them. Whale-bane, especially, could not quite decipher their purpose. I laughed too harshly, when he first tried to sit down; with those swimmer's thighs, he just wailed and wailed and fell onto the ice<br/>

    I can see him, now, flailing and flirting. When his brothers got him up, it took off a layer of skin, leaving behind a tattered memoir of our day together<br/>

    I dreamt again of Whale-bane, of Ring-In-Opal, of being back amongst his people. I dreamt of the afternoon that they took me to their Mint. Whale-Bane himself led the hunt for the gold; he was the elegance of his people, and I can imagine him now, standing in his furs on the prow of a particularly grand berg, harpoon in hand, his cock tanned with circulation despite the blizzard <br/>
    <br/>
    they spotted a pod, a few miles out, and diving like snakes, like dragons, into the white-capped waves, before long they brought the corpses ashore, a calf and its mother, and out of the groins, the mother's the size of a doorway, they pulled a pair of golden rings. Whale-bane had made the kill, and so he took the rings, currency pierced there by his grandfathers and great-grandfathers, for safekeeping, and spent them as inheritance.<br/>
    <br/>
    One passed to me, the other to his brother, as a debt paid. <br/>
    <br/>
    I danced and skidded with my handsome Whale-bane on the snow while the corpses of the fish were slid into the water behind us. I would not stay for his brother's piercing, and I was afraid that they would do the same to me.<br/>
    <br/>
    I asked him that night if they ever ate whale, and he laughed that jackal laugh of his, him who had never seen something with more than two legs, and said<br/>

    <b>Trottering Notes: </b></b>Pulp degradation abated, and mycelium liquor, in place of the usual gall ink, preserved in line with the Myiasis designation (see above); the flies are still mostly living, and horned, having produced a dermis of illegitimate larvae against the acidity of the soil; despite numerous tectonic events, saltwater intrusion and superior <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span> disturbance, a successive walling has been established down the years; the air and mulch recycled to plaster over a new layer of defence. The soil is far more nutritious and appealing for the <i>sarcobalneum</i> than the Eremite's choice of parchment.</p>


    <p>The Eremite's acceptance of a lack of menses ritual in Loss perhaps points to a lack of cultural currency about his person. Despite his civilisation, learning, wanderlust and deduction, he has not been permitted inside the normative sphere of Loss, and thus cannot accept that something may be hidden from him; instead, his ego sees nothing. </p>

    <p>Unacceptable. The Eremite's position of sexual primacy with the female “Friend”, or “Death Of A Friend” (depending on honorific) points to a deep insinuation into the social fabric of Loss. Perhaps not every civilisation is as obsessed with failed potential as yours was.</p>

    <p>\\__Clerk//// Wayle, I have your Work in front of me, and whilst I am not used to the formator the language, I can see that it has been noted that you are angry, and rather insignificant. I have a petition here from you for a specific promotion, “Deplorsy Minor”; it seems that you, also, are aware that you are not yet a senior <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span>, and should not be engaging in these Excavations, let alone answering this question. Return the piece to the Marvel Ouse immediately.</p>

    </br>
    <p><span class="red">____</span>Clerk<span class="red">____</span>, I find it appalling that not one senior clerk can pluck up the courage, or stymie the shakes in their sleeves, to argue with you. The people of Loss are a tame, trusting people, this much can be seen, especially from Common Compression Name “The Tides In My Soup”. Given the Eremite's proven record of gaining (and maintaining) the trust of the uncivilised, it seems unlikely that they would keep something as mundane as a bleeding rite secret from him. They had, at this point, already given him so much.</p>

    <p>I see you have received your promotion since we last corresponded. I shall have to come and find you, and see to your pain. In the meantime, I would refer your attention to the fact of the matter, the fact of the whole of the Eremite's time in Loss; he was never, ever permitted to spend the night inside the village walls. Despite his accumulated dunnage creating an ersatz settlement far bigger than Loss itself, they were at no point cowed, and only allowed him ingress before dark. I think that this piece demonstrates this better than most.</p>

Second-party analysis leads to conclusion that these are all extracts from very disparate parts of the Pilot's Book; the near-destruction of some, and the preservation of others, and the nature of their degradation, supports this theorem. The same sodium damage and sluice patterns are evident as in other fragments, but some of the fragments, most notably Fragment 3, have been carbonised with a pepper flame of 26,000K. If the editor has olfactory rights, they may detect a hint of burbage and cinnamon about the fragment.

    <p>Consider this my theory. An editor must work within extremely tight confines of mind and matter, and assumptions based on incomplete evidence, whilst occasionally contaminatory, can elucidate new modes of thinking. By combining the fragments in this manner, some ripped deliberately from their binding, others teased by the motions of wave and wind, I hope to draw something from them, some connection which maybe the Eremite intended, but was unable to pronounce without ripping his protopus to shreds.</p>

    <b>Notes</b>
    <p>

    An excellent, sparse example of Eremite diagrammaton, focussing on a perplexing idiosyncracy 

    of the Lossian primigravida; the gradual disappearance, throughout the pregnancy, of not just the 

    foetus from the mother's stomach but the uterus, womb, fallopian machinery, fat, muscle, skin, 

    hair, blood and viscera that accompanies it. This 'Lantern' is referred to by the Eremite on one or 

    two other occasions, and her progress from community slut to hollow warrior, her empty abdomen 

    her concave shield and her pregnancy her heroine-quest, is fascinating in its detail. My own people 

    never had such reverence for would-be mothers, but the Eremite, bizarrely, even seems moved by 

    her plight. The death of the infant is unfortunate, but this <span class="red">_\\_</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span> feels that a certain amount 

    of transcendant detachment, on the Eremite's part, would have been more appropriate. Anything, 

    rather than this paean.

    <p>Notes</p>


    <p>My travels through the bedrock of the Institute have garnered me to a little hollow, very close to the permafrost. I think my ears popped fifteen separate times, on my spiral downwards. I was able to crawl all the way in, and in that little crypt was what I thought was a door, taller than I was and studded with such beautiful designs, picked out in antediluvian copper. I felt like I was in the belly of the whale again, but this time I did not need to make my own slit. Please note, <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerks<span class="red">////</span>, that the little hollow, and any Excavations that they may proffer, are now the reserve of senior clerks, myself, only. We will not be sharing our Work.</p>
    
    <p>I will allow those of you who have Excavated this far a little hint of what I enjoyed, however. I grasped the edges of the door, and pulled. It came away at a familiar enough angle, but beyond it there was not a room; only concertinaed earth. Pinioned to its rear surface was this Excavation, and several others, still berg-white, after all these years. It was then that I deduced, in all my learning, in how far I have burrowed since I joined this Institute, that this was the front cover of  the Eremite's great Work on Loss. I had not expected it to be so large. I can now imagine him so clearly, creaking the latch open every night to make a new entry, groaning as he was forced to bend, to scribe it at the very jamb of the page. </p>
    
    <p>I did as my Work dictates; I tore this and the others from their housing, and scattered them through the tunnels I had made when I returned. I hope you Excavate them promptly; I am not sure how long their purity will remain, in the cannibal earth. </p>
    
    <p>Chester-Stokes would have loved this! So proper, so fat with meaning, just like her. I almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost miss her.</p>

    <span class="red">____</span><i>Experto Crede</i><span class="red">____</span>
    </p>
    <p>It has been an era since I have turned my hand to transcription, and it is never a happy day when that hand is forced. A Work that is dying, its intricacies blurring and ribboning, is a sadder thing than losing one's child, I <span class="red">imagine</span>. All that is left here to handle is a dog-ear, or perhaps the ring-finger, of what once was. There is little to identify its provenance, nothing of the <i>caput</i>, or the <i>cor</i>, only his latitude, the stars.</P>

    <p>It is lucky then, <span class="red">___\</span>clerks<span class="red">//_/</span>, that I am adapted to such calamities, and possess an Alexandrian memory. It must have been all the declensions that I was forced to learn. </p>

    <p>Can any of you, in your states, remember your parents?</p>

    <span class="red">SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</span>

    <p>I do. I remember the day that Daddy sped off in the sidecar. It was not June, and so the rock-rose was bloody in the clints. Mummy and I followed in the wagon, across the virgate and down to the port, and watched him standing, on the deck of Mummy's ferry, shouting that he would 'knock up some Boche ponces', or some equally stupid Babel, translated on the wind. </p>

    <p>His sergeant brought back his wedding ring before Guy Fawkes Night. As Norris served him tea, he told us how twenty privates had tried to steal it from his pocket, as he zigged and zagged his way back to England through the trenches. I can see it so very clearly, the herringbone of his trousers, and the little cardboard box perched atop them. I loved that comparison; it looked a little like our house, stood in fertile fields.</p>

    <p>The sergeant opened the box, and took out, very carefully, twenty fingers, and laid them on the Pembroke table. Of course, none of them were Daddy's, and so we shooed the sergeant from our life. We fed the fingers to the pigs. </p>

    <p>It would pay all of you, <span class="red">___\</span>clerks<span class="red">//_/</span>, to practice. Remember the little things. What did they call the herbs and flowers, where you were from? What weather touched you?</p>

    <p>Exercises for another time. </p>

    <p>No matter how much I might remember of this Work, day after day after day we are losing more of what he was planning to say. This Work was a series of notations, for some grander, dreamt mural. I do wish that we had Uncle Oscar's writings here, and Praester's unshredded and sensible. Together, they might flare into so many of those trenches in my revision. </p>

    <p>Without the whole Work, for instance, we will never know what Friend was really like, as a person, or whether she did love him, as he so desperate to be loved. We will never know what became of the Bog Ponies, or whether the Town Cryer was a man or a woman or something else, or what it was that the Eremite did to Mr. Lights, in those lonely, ultimate days on the valley floor.</p>

    <p>What we have instead, left behind, is a quinquereme preparation, an <i>itinerarium</i> of travel out of Loss, a road diary a little more juvenile than most. Only one scrap of page remains; let us see quite how much of the rest I remember, from previous readings. It is puzzling; the rest of me is waning, planing down to the grain, but my mind stays as sharp as an <i>ensis</i>. I have not quite descended to the sty just yet.</p>

    <p>I think that I might know who I am.</p>

    <p>I cannot be expected to remember quite everything, <i>veritas</i>;. The parts that I do remember I have put into order of pressure, as best I am able, and though I am no artist I have provided descriptions of the sketches and scenes that made a particular impression on my young mind. All stress is the Eremite's, not my own, though gaps may be in my own knowledge or in the record itself. </p>

    <p>Firstly, the <i>contexte</i>. It seems that the Eremite was by now already on the long road out of Loss, the caprine, darting track plotted in the stars and the breadcrumbs of himself, trudging in the other direction all that time before. We may assume, from the notes that he made on each day of his journey, that he was finding it hard to delude himself any longer. His guilt at the death of Loss, at the dousing of an entire folk, is so impregnated throughout. Look at the records of his breath, recorded every evening. We can <span class="red">imagine</span> that he did not sleep much. Nor was there any reason to hide these records; he was so assured of his companion's illiteracy that he knew that his crimes would never be understood. What were thirty-nine scratches, every single day, to a Friend?</p>

    <p>The records of breath do confirm one of the Eremite's virtues; throughout his entire life, no matter his dimension, he was extremely regular in every faculty. Look to the tabulations and calculations throughout <i>The Underweather Vanity</i>. He has even boasted, in other Works, of cults marking their festivals by his toilet. And indeed, the breaths here do form a calendar; thirty nine, without fail, in and out, every single day. </p>

    <p>However, as you all should have been taught, every calendar has its leap. There was one such energetic day, in Loss, a hot day when he was unsated by the cooking of the very worst cook, and decided to eat from a different sort of plate.</p>

    <p>The Eremite has made no secret in the record that he wanted Friend, in that childish way that we have all come to recognise. I thought that I might have to puzzle it out, this calamity that murdered a public, but he was almost triumphant in his blatancy.</p>

    <p>On the day that he removed his mask and kissed her, he registered only thirty breaths, in and out of his tubes.</p>

    <p>Nine is not an important number, in any theology that I know of, but he would spend the rest of his time in Loss fixated upon those lost breaths, trying not to accuse himself. <i>I feel well</i>, we can <span class="red">imagine</span> him telling himself, <i>there is nothing wrong with me</i>, as they moaned through the dirt all around him. He was always so excellent at <span class="red">imagining</span> other outcomes and other blames. Perhaps he might have blamed Friend for distracting him, for making him lose count that day, for some atmospheric disturbance, the influence of spirits, anything, but his own want. </p>

    <p>You can just <span class="red">imagine</span> him, can't you, boygirls, on the road, checking her from temple to temple, looking for any sort of mantle, probing her mouth with those incredible fingers, hunting for cobblestones. He would even check her back, for the bruises that the rest of her people developed, evidence, he thought, of flagellation. </p>

    <p>But, of course, he would find nothing on her, and so reinforce his delusion that he had not infected them. She did not wear a black crown, and so he enthroned her in other ways, certain of his innocence. If she was well, the only one who had smelt his breath in a hundred years, then he could not be accused.</p>

    <p>But who was there still to accuse him? </p>

    <p>The pigs, for all their lack of discernment, did teach me something as a girl. I often found them very gross, and would stand at the edge of the sty after school, shouting my subjunctives in and listening for the screams back.</p>

    <p>Mummy and Daddy showed me, however, how the beasts could be used as a barometer. About five times in my infanthood a plague would pass through the herd, and they were loath to cull the whole lot. And so they would quietly walk amongst them, wearing homemade masks out of sack and snorkel, and make an inspection. They would ignore the sows turning out cold paste instead of milk, ignore the backfatters grinding their teeth into flour, ignore the boars corning each other in blind rages. </p>

    <p>Before long, they would find the happiest pig, the one without sores or mucus, and lead it off to be shot, far from any watercourse.</p>

    know that promised would not dram and none of this been a dream at all<br/>

    <br/>
    <i>mercenaria mercenaria</i><br/>
    <br/>
    was a noble beast, when I met it, but all this hunger now<br/>
    is making me impolite; am imagining it steamed with butter<br/>

    it brought me to <br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="red">[A<i> lacunae</i>.]</span><br/>
    <br/>
    Ring-In-Opal, on the red tide. It was a pleasant journey with the Lord Quahog, most royal of his kind, and he let me touch the crown jewels nestled in his bivalve. I can almost taste the jacuzzi of blood that I sat in, reclining on his anus. It was too cold for algae, so we motored through the floes, up to the boundary of Ring-In-Opal itself, two slabs of bull ice<br/>
    <br/>
    I remember the mist coiling off them with envy <br/>
    is so hot here today<br/>
    all the suns have followed me<br/>
    a fold of them in the SSS <br/>
    <br/>
    i sent her on ahead instead<br/>
    gave the smaller luggage<br/>
    telling to meet me in two days<br/>
    she will not get far<br/>
    she is sik<span class="red">[sic]</span> with an empty belly<br/>
    but not homesick one bit<br/>
    <br/>
    I think shes forgotten about them all already<br/>
    <br/>
    i can think clearly now, with her gone <br/>
    I can spend the day in Ring-In-Opal<br/>
    <br/>
    I had long since said farewell to Lord Quahog, and been amongst them for many days, before I met Whale-bane. He considered himself a bard, and though he was not much of a singer, just a boy in a fine coat, all he did was pluck. He knew gut very well. They all did, in Ring-In-Opal. <br/>
    <br/>
    They liked me there.<br/>
    <br/>
    I remember, floating over the diplomat behind me on swim bladders - they loved that, too, it was all the more ice, all the more territory, for them. There was not a horse chestnut for leagues, but it didn't matter<br/>
    <br/>
    Every day, before he found the courage to introduce himself, he watched me from his berg, the skins drawn around his waist, brown walrus, or was it white?
    I saw the tusks above his bed<br/>

    <br/>
    Ring-In-Opal, as a civilisation, did not have chairs either, but unlike Friend they were fascinated by them. Whale-bane, especially, could not quite decipher their purpose. I laughed too harshly, when he first tried to sit down; with those swimmer's thighs, he just wailed and wailed and fell onto the ice<br/>
    <br/>
    I can see him, now, flailing and flirting. When his brothers got him up, it took off a layer of skin, leaving behind a tattered memoir of our day together<br/>

    I dreamt again of Whale-bane, of Ring-In-Opal, of being back amongst his people. I dreamt of the afternoon that they took me to their Mint. Whale-Bane himself led the hunt for the gold; he was the elegance of his people, and I can imagine him now, standing in his furs on the prow of a particularly grand berg, harpoon in hand, his cock tanned with circulation despite the blizzard <br/>
    <br/>
    they spotted a pod, a few miles out, and diving like snakes, like dragons, into the white-capped waves, before long they brought the corpses ashore, a calf and its mother, and out of the groins, the mother's the size of a doorway, they pulled a pair of golden rings. Whale-bane had made the kill, and so he took the rings, currency pierced there by his grandfathers and great-grandfathers, for safekeeping, and spent them as inheritance.<br/>
    <br/>
    One passed to me, the other to his brother, as a debt paid. <br/>
    <br/>
    I danced and skidded with my handsome Whale-bane on the snow while the corpses of the fish were slid into the water behind us. I would not stay for his brother's piercing, and I was afraid that they would do the same to me.<br/>
    <br/>
    I asked him that night if they ever ate whale, and he laughed that jackal laugh of his, him who had never seen something with more than two legs, and said<br/>

Very minor bacillus growth, but no water damage and small wood fibre rot mainly concentrated in the peripherals of the document (enzymes associated with expectoration). The document's condition can be attributed to snug shelter derived from the Great Work itself, and due to the continuity of the marginalia can be placed directly after the Bowspirit in inspiration and expiration. 

    <p>This is an excellent example of Classical Islandscript, with the Eremite's undeniable flair and loneliness of thought. I have determined through glossal interaction that the medium is undiluted iron gall ink, confirming wild theories elsewhere.

    A savage beauty? I’m not sure if we are looking at the same pelt, <span class="red">\\\\</span>Clerk!<span class="red">////</span> I know that you are flush with your discovery, but hyperbole won’t get us anywhere. From what I see, gelation has set in completely, especially around the dorsal flippers; it looks stillborn. Given the lack of artifice involved, we can deduce that the original purveyors of this map were primitive; therefore, such a waste of a valuable skin would have been foolhardy in the extreme. Also, the accuracy of the map is entirely debatable, as we have very little evidence that the Eremite used the map to reach Loss. Amongst with Jenny and his suite of other tools, this is only one, and far less accurate. And, considering that the basis for the triangulation used on the map are the arbitrary positions of  welts and sores on the poor beast’s skin, I think that what we are looking at are the products of an oracle, and a rather poor one at that. You and I both know how given the Eremite was to gifts, regardless of their use.
